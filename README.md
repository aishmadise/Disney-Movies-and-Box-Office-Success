# Disney-Movies-and-Box-Office-Success
I found a really interesting project that allowed me to apply my knowledge of exploratory data analysis (EDA) and predictive machine learning models.

A brief description of the project: 
Walt Disney Studios is the foundation on which The Walt Disney Company was built. The Studios has produced more than 600 films since their debut film, Snow White and 
the Seven Dwarfs in 1937. While many of its films were big hits, some of them were not. In this notebook, we will explore a dataset of Disney movies and analyze what 
contributes to the success of Disney movies.

Note: The dataset used in this project is a modified version of the Disney Character Success dataset from https://data.world/kgarrett/disney-character-success-00-16.

What did I apply to this project?

1.Data manipulation using Pandas 
2.Data visualization using Seaborn 
3.Two-sample bootstrap hypothesis testing 
4.Building a regression model using Scikit-Learn
